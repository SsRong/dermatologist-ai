## Introduction

In this mini project, you will design an algorithm that can visually diagnose [melanoma](http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma), the deadliest form of skin cancer.  In particular, your algorithm will distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions ([nevi](http://missinglink.ucsf.edu/lm/dermatologyglossary/nevus.html) and [seborrheic keratoses](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/bumps-and-growths/seborrheic-keratoses)). 

The data and objective are pulled from the [2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a).  As part of the challenge, participants were tasked to design an algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis).  In this project, you will create a model to generate your own predictions.

## My own algorithm

Open [my Jupyter Notebook dermatologist-ai.ipynb](dermatologist-ai.ipynb) to see how I trained a Convolution Neural Network to classify the three skin diseases and reached a __Mean ROC AUC score of 0.929__ (see ROC curves for melanoma and seborrheic keratosis below). It would have been a __TOP 1__ in the challenge (see scores in [Evaluation](#evaluation)). It's very satisfying for what I wanted to achieve, especially since the __winner's score is 0.911__.  ðŸ˜ƒ

But much more than this score, I learned a lot and sometimes the hard way, and took a lot of fun. ðŸ˜…

Particularly, I share how I turned my many mistakes while designing the model into positive learning experiences!

The Jupyter Notebook was run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with GPU activated.  

## Getting Started

Click the link below to open notebook in Google Colab:
[<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sebastienlange/dermatologist-ai/blob/master/dermatologist_ai.ipynb)

Then press Ctrl+F9 to Execute all cells in the notebook

Be patient, it takes 12 minutes(*) to execute all the notebook cells: 
Download (5') and extract (3') default images
Download (1') and extract additional images
Download results for all pretrained models (1')
Build the best team (1')
All other cells (1')
(*) timing is of course approximate

Add +/- 13 minutes if you want to skip loading results and force testing, because the very first time it will need to resize all images.

Add many hours if you want to train your own model ðŸ˜Š
